# ao review

Manage AO's native code reviewer for a worker's PR.

AO's reviewer is an isolated reviewer agent, not another worker session. To get
an adversarial review of an AO session's PR, use `ao review trigger`; never
spawn a worker to review it. Inside a worker, the review commands default to
the calling session (`AO_SESSION_ID`), so `ao review trigger` reviews your own
PR. An orchestrator passes the worker's session id.

AO's review is internal. An AO approval is not a GitHub approval: it does not
satisfy required or independent-account reviews or branch protection, and it
does not authorize merging.

## Syntax

```
ao review <subcommand> [args] [flags]
```

The review loop can be inspected, submitted, cancelled, or triggered again.

## Subcommands

---

### ao review ls

List review runs for a worker session (default: the calling session). Alias: `list`.

**Syntax:**
```
ao review ls [worker-session-id] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Meaning | Default / Required |
|---|---|---|
| `--json` | Output reviews as JSON | - |

**Example:**

```bash
ao review ls mer-3
```

---

### ao review submit

Record a reviewer's result for a worker's PR.

**Syntax:**
```
ao review submit [worker-session-id] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Meaning | Default / Required |
|---|---|---|
| `--body string` | Review body: a path to a Markdown file, or `-` to read from stdin | - |
| `--review-id string` | Id of the GitHub PR review just posted (the `.id` from the `gh api` POST that created the review) | - |
| `--reviews string` | JSON review results array or object: a path, or `-` to read from stdin | - |
| `--run string` | Review run id | Required |
| `--session string` | Worker session id (or pass it as the positional argument) | - |
| `--verdict string` | Review verdict: `approved` or `changes_requested` | Required |

If the local daemon is restarting when a result is submitted, AO retains the
parsed result in memory and retries the same idempotent request for up to 30
seconds. Validation errors return immediately. If the daemon remains unavailable,
the command reports failure and can be repeated safely; daemon idempotency
handles the case where an earlier connection dropped after committing the result.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Submit an approved review for session mer-3
ao review submit mer-3 --run review-run-1 --verdict approved
```

```bash
# Submit a changes-requested review with a body from stdin
echo "Please fix the null check on line 42." | ao review submit --session mer-3 --run review-run-1 --verdict changes_requested --body -
```

---

### ao review cancel

Cancel every running review for a worker's PR (default: the calling session). Alias: `stop`.

**Syntax:**
```
ao review cancel [worker-session-id] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Meaning | Default / Required |
|---|---|---|
| `--session string` | Worker session id (or pass it positionally) | - |

**Example:**

```bash
ao review cancel mer-3
```

---

### ao review trigger

Start AO's reviewer on a worker's open PR heads (default: the calling session).
Aliases: `execute`, `restart`. Reviewer panes cannot run it.

**Syntax:**
```
ao review trigger [worker-session-id] [flags]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Meaning | Default / Required |
|---|---|---|
| `--session string` | Worker session id (or pass it positionally) | The calling AO session |
| `--agent string` | Reviewer agent for this pass only (alias `--harness`) | Session reviewer, then project reviewer, then the project's default worker agent |
| `--model string` | Reviewer model for this pass only | As above |
| `--effort string` | Reviewer reasoning effort for this pass only | As above |
| `--rerun` | Review a head that already has a review again, or add a reviewer with a different agent alongside one that is still running | - |
| `--no-inject` | Leave the session's review auto-inject setting unchanged | Auto-inject is turned on |

A head that is already being reviewed, or already has a review, is not reviewed
again: the command exits 1 with `REVIEW_ALREADY_RUNNING` or
`REVIEW_HEAD_ALREADY_REVIEWED` and says what to do. Push new commits, or pass
`--rerun`. The same reviewer agent never runs twice on one head at the same time.

By default the command turns on the worker session's review auto-inject, so the
result (changes requested or approved) is delivered to the worker. Check results
with `ao review ls`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Inside a worker: request a review of this session's PR once it is ready
ao review trigger
```

```bash
# Orchestrator: review a worker's PR with a specific reviewer
ao review trigger mer-3 --agent codex --model gpt-5.5
```

```bash
# Add a second opinion on the same commit while the first reviewer runs
ao review trigger --agent claude-code --rerun
```
